          "synopsis": "Tanjirou Kamado lives with his impoverished family on a remote mountain. As the oldest sibling, he took upon the responsibility of ensuring his family's livelihood after the death of his father. On a cold winter day, he goes down to the local village in order to sell some charcoal. As dusk falls, he is forced to spend the night in the house of a curious man who cautions him of strange creatures that roam the night: malevolent demons who crave human flesh. When he finally makes his way home, Tanjirou's worst nightmare comes true. His entire family has been brutally slaughtered with the sole exception of his sister Nezuko, who has turned into a flesh-eating demon. Engulfed in hatred and despair, Tanjirou desperately tries to stop Nezuko from attacking other people, setting out on a journey to avenge his family and find a way to turn his beloved sister back into a human.

Even after a valiant fight, he fails to kill those responsible and faces his own end. But fate has other plans... Instead of taking his last breath, he awakens as a child, training to be an elite soldier of a demonic sect. Now Unseong must embrace the demonic arts and harness power in his ultimate quest for revenge. (Source: Tapas Media)",

Just when she's looking for a way back to her original world, the demon lord's butler shows up and offers her a tour of his castle. And so, Elina jumps at the opportunity to travel to the demon realm and learn magic that can transport her back to her own dimension. Little does she know that the demon lord's servants are scheming to make her his bride so he can produce an heir and strengthen his political power... (Source: Tappytoon)",

          "synopsis": "At a glance, high-schooler Moran Baek appears to be a beautiful girl who's perfect in every way... or so it would seem. In reality, she is an exiled demon who has been trapped in a human body for over 5,000 years. When she learns that she is still unable to use her demonic powers despite finishing her exile, Moran despairs and struggles to find a way to become a demon again. One day, she accidentally discovers that doing a good deed restores her powers, and sets out to find a way to keep doing good deeds so she can return to her devilish ways. (Source: Tappytoon)",
