          "synopsis": "Denji has a simple dream—to live a happy and peaceful life, spending time with a girl he likes. This is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils in order to pay off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil Pochita as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash. Unfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered by a devil in contract with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji's dead body and grants him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform parts of his body into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new abilities to quickly and brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official devil hunters who arrive at the scene, he is offered work at the Public Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the means to face even the toughest of enemies, Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage dreams. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "In 2006, a patient of a psychologist in New York sketched the portrait of a man she had repeatedly seen in her dreams. After several other patients claimed to have seen the same person in their dreams, the image was made public. Soon, there were reports from many others around the world who claimed that the same man appeared in their sleep. \"This Man\"—as he came to be known—eventually became nothing more than an urban legend. In present-day Japan, forensic sketch artist Hakaru Amano uses his illustration skills to assist the Kumamoto Metropolitan Police. His life, however, changes when he meets Hoshiko Akesato, who approaches Hakaru in hopes that he can draw the man that appeared outside her home the week before. When he finishes his sketch, he is surprised to see that it is the same face as This Man. Not long afterward, Hoshiko witnesses This Man brutally murder her mother while Hakaru's apartment is set on fire. When the artist finally encounters This Man outside his building, Hakaru is given an ominous warning that death awaits those who lay eyes on This Man. When it becomes clear that the mysterious perpetrator has allies within the city, Hakaru and Hoshiko are forced into hiding. Nevertheless, Hakaru resolves to hunt down and capture This Man and his accomplices before they can strike again. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The suspect was a man with a skull-like helmet and a cape and clothing as black as the inside of a grave. Accompanied by a shape-shifting beast named Garo, the Skull Man terrified Japanese society—without giving the people a clear reason why. (Source: MU)",
          "background": "Skull Man was one of manga's first anti-heroes, someone who would sacrifice the lives of innocents in his quest for vengeance. While the TV series Kamen Rider (Masked Rider) was still in development, Ishinomori, who created that series with producer Toru Hirayama, made this manga as his own personal version, which the producers at Toei Company Ltd. used as the basis for the show. Several changes in content were made, as this 100-page one-shot story was too dark and gruesome (even cerebral) for a children's show. (Source: Wikipedia)",

          "synopsis": "Thousands of years ago, there existed those gifted with the power of God. Their mission: to destroy the ominous evils that lurk in the darkness known as \"Akuma.\" Led by the Milenium Earl, Akuma seek to destroy fragments of \"Innocence,\" the only weapons capable of harming the Earl and his army and bring about the Great Flood from a hundred years ago. To prevent this tragedy from happening, the Black Order was formed as an organization dedicated to fighting the Earl. They recruit Exorcists, those with the inherent ability to accomodate Innocence, to fight against the Akuma. In the late 19th century, Allen Walker—a white-haired boy armed with Innocence that takes the form of his entire left arm and a cursed eye that can see Akuma—is sent to the Black Order. There, Allen meets various comrades from the Order—the mercurial Yuu Kanda, the kindhearted Lenalee Lee, and the cheerful yet mysterious Lavi. Despite their different personalities, they have one goal in mind: to bring salvation to the souls of Akuma and prevent the Earl from destroying the world. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They are banded together by a pledge to deliver. Fast. Precise. Secure. Banya, the craziest and craftiest of the bunch, will stop at nothing to get a job done.
