Gorou Amemiya is a countryside gynecologist and a big fan of Ai. So when the pregnant idol shows up at his hospital, he is beyond bewildered. Gorou promises her a safe delivery. Little does he know, an encounter with a mysterious figure would result in his untimely death—or so he thought. Opening his eyes in the lap of his beloved idol, Gorou finds that he has been reborn as Aquamarine Hoshino—Ai's newborn son! With his world turned upside down, Gorou soon learns that the world of showbiz is paved with thorns, where talent does not always beget success. Will he manage to protect Ai's smile that he loves so much with the help of an eccentric and unexpected ally? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Berta's marriage was suddenly arranged, she will become the second consort of the King. The current royal family values lineage above all else, with several generations of consanguineous marriages, to preserve its \"purity.\" The politics of the Kingdom, following the idea of the pureblood noblemen's superiority, caused national power to decline. To retain the power of the Kingdom, the Royal Family decided to take a desperate measure, a marriage with a woman from the ethnic group to which belongs the majority of the population. The bitterness of this act... Those who were previously considered a subjugated group of people living on the frontiers. The chosen bride is Berta, the first daughter of the current lord of Kasha, the largest estate on the frontier and also a powerful faction. The marriage life started in hard mode, a husband that doesn't love her, a Queen that hates her, however, she still is forced to fulfil her role duties. Berta has decided to endure the hardship, that was already expected by her, and wait for the day when there's no more need of her in the palace, and she can return home. However, Berta's initial plans are ruined by an unexpected situation. After passing three nights with the King, as the royal rules dictated for a newlywed bride, Berta got pregnant with His Majesty's child!! (Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",

          "synopsis": "I love romantic comedy manga. However, my favorite heroine is a sub-heroine, a loser heroine who will never be able to connect with the protagonist. One day I was hit by a truck and woke up to find myself playing the role of the hero's best friend in a romantic comedy manga. Yeah, this is probably a dream. I'm dreaming about being hit by a truck. In the scene where the hero's best friend is talking alone with my favorite heroine, I possessed that best friend. In the classroom alone with my favorite heroine, all I have to do is to say it. \"I like you.\" \"What? What are you suddenly saying...?!\" \"I'll make you happy. I want you to go out with me.\" \"Huh?!\" Because I was dreaming, I casually told her. If this wakes me up from my dream, I won't have any regrets. ...Hey, I can't wake up from my dream? It's usually the next day, you know? What, am I reincarnated as this character by any chance? This is the story of how I make sure my favorite heroine is happy. (Source: Kakuyomu, translated)",

Surrounded by attractive men all vying for her attention would be any maiden's dream—but that is not the case for Rae! None of them can hold a candle to the villainess, Claire François, whose blonde, drill-shaped ringlets only accentuate her haughty irresistible charm. In the original story, Claire harasses and bullies the heroine, which drives the latter closer to the male love interests. But Rae has no intention of pursuing any of the men; her heart is set on Claire herself! Unused to being on the receiving end of affection, Claire is left at the mercy of Rae's endless teasing. With the power of true love, can Rae successfully convey her heartfelt feelings to the villainess? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He finds himself frustrated day in and day out. The one thing he loves more than anything are the beauty videos made by his favorite online beauty streamer, Sakaki. But watching Sakaki's cross-dressing and men's makeup tutorials, Harumi finds himself so entranced that he just can't help but jerk himself off, which fills him with even more self-loathing. One day, Harumi sees his idol in the store he works at, and even gets the chance to help him try on some makeup. As he applies Sakaki's lipstick, Harumi is caught between the greatest happiness of his life and his own crushing sense of guilt... Which one will win out!? (Source: GOT)",
